\subsection*{The Status Quo}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Status Quo}

Work has already been done in the space. Intel's Sandy Bridge architecture moved the GPGPU form the north-bridge onto the CPU chip itself. This may have been for either cost saving reasons or for performance, but this represented a step in the march towards a heterogeneous architecture. Their fusion placed the GPGPU onto the die sharing a L3 cache and main memory. It however, is not, integrated into the CPU itself (as a heterogeneous architecture would be). 

Even still, some of the architecture choices
