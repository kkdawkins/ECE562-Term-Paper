\begin{abstract}
In this project I will investigate the shift in architectures occurring in the GPGPU (General Purpose GPU, as opposed to simple graphics GPU) space. Current generation architectures place the GPGPUs over the PCI-e bus and move data from main memory to the GPGPU specific memory across the front side bus as necessary. However, a shift is occurring, and the next generation architectures (for example, Nvidia's Tegra 5) are beginning to incorporate the GPGPUs into the main CPU complex itself.  This heterogeneous multicore architecture solves some problems such as the data movement across the PCIe bus, but creates its own set of challenges related to memory, timing and ISA design since the GPGPU runs much differently than the CPU. \\

This project will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multicore CPU systems with mixed CPU and GPGPU forms of computing, and investigate into the future architecture of the system in a heterogeneous multicore world.
